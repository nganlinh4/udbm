# Template Modularization

The `templates/index.html` file has been successfully modularized into smaller, reusable components for better maintainability and organization.

## New Structure

### Base Template
- **`base.html`** - Main HTML structure with head include and content block

### Main Template
- **`index.html`** - Now extends base.html and includes all components (reduced from 729 lines to 16 lines)

### Components Directory (`templates/components/`)

1. **`head.html`** - All head section content including:
   - Meta tags and external CSS/JS imports
   - Inline JavaScript for language and theme initialization
   - Mermaid configuration

2. **`initial-setup.html`** - Database setup screen including:
   - Setup form for new database connections
   - Language and theme switchers for initial setup

3. **`header.html`** - Main interface header including:
   - Title bar with monitoring controls
   - Database switcher with favicon/logo controls
   - Connection status indicator
   - Page title container

4. **`controls.html`** - Control panel including:
   - Schema button
   - Admin mode toggle with tooltip
   - Language switcher
   - Theme switcher

5. **`table-interface.html`** - Table management interface including:
   - Smart ordering toggle
   - Table buttons with counts
   - Table containers with Jinja2 loops

6. **`popups.html`** - All modal dialogs including:
   - Warning and notification popups
   - Custom SQL query popup
   - Schema visualization modal
   - Full-view image modal

7. **`scripts.html`** - All JavaScript functionality including:
   - Main module imports
   - Schema initialization
   - Page title management
   - Table toggle functionality
   - Event listeners and observers

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability** - Each component focuses on a specific functionality
2. **Reusability** - Components can be reused across different templates
3. **Readability** - Main template is now much cleaner and easier to understand
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Related functionality is grouped together
5. **Easier Debugging** - Issues can be isolated to specific components
6. **Team Collaboration** - Different developers can work on different components

## Usage

The modular structure uses Jinja2 template inheritance and includes:

```jinja2
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    {% include 'components/initial-setup.html' %}
    {% include 'components/header.html' %}
    {% include 'components/controls.html' %}
    {% include 'components/table-interface.html' %}
    {% include 'components/popups.html' %}
    {% include 'components/scripts.html' %}
{% endblock %}
```

All template variables and Jinja2 functionality remain exactly the same as the original implementation.
